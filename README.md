# EV3 Racing Project (Ongoing)

This project is about programming a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot to race on a custom-built track.  
The focus is on **autonomous navigation**, **sensor integration** (color and ultrasonic), and **algorithm design** for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.  

## Features
- Track following using color sensor  
- Obstacle detection and avoidance with ultrasonic sensor  
- Adjustable speed and difficulty  
- Modular code structure for testing different strategies  

## Status
ðŸš§ Ongoing â€“ currently refining navigation logic and improving race consistency.  

## Goals
- Optimize speed while keeping stability  
- Implement advanced pathfinding logic  
- Add logging for performance analysis
